0.5.1 (2006-06-22):
  - Added hotfix for twisted.test.proto_helpers.StringTransport.

0.5.0 (2006-06-12):
  - Replaced '%y' with '%Y' in Time.asHumanly() output - the year is now
    four digits, rather than two.
  - Added new 'epsilon.structlike' functionality for simple record.
  - All uses of defer.wait and deferredResult were removed from the tests.
  - Added epsilon.juice, an asynchronous messaging protocol slated for
    inclusion in Twisted.  Improved a few features, such as the repr() of
    JuiceBox instances.  This was moved from Vertex.
  - Added epsilon.sslverify, a set of utilities for dealing with PyOpenSSL
    using simple high-level objects, performing operations such as signing and
    verifying certificates.  This was also moved from Vertex, and slated for
    inclusion in Twisted.
  - Added epsilon.spewer, a prettier version of the spewer in
    twisted.python.util.
  - Added "benchmark" tool for measuring and reporting run-times of python
    programs.

0.4.0 (2005-12-20):
  - Disabled crazy sys.modules hackery in test_setuphelper
  - Added module for creating a directory structure from a string template
  - Added support for 'now' to Time.fromHumanly()
  - Added a structured "hotfix" system to abstract and formalize monkey
    patches and version testing logic away from code which requires it.

0.3.2 (2005-11-05):
  - Added automatic support for Twisted plugins to autosetup

0.3.1 (2005-11-02):
  - Removed bogus dependency on Axiom.

0.3.0 (2005-11-02):
  - Added SchedulingService, an IService implementation, to epsilon.cooperator
  - Added autosetup, a utility to actually include files in distutils releases,
    to epsilon.setuphelper

0.2.1 (2005-10-25):
  - Added 'short()' to epsilon.versions.Version
  - fixed setup.py to use epsilon.version.short() rather than static string.

0.2.0 (2005-10-25):
  - Added epsilon.modal.ModalType, metaclass for writing classes that
    behave in some respects like state machines
